# raydor
Static site gene"raydor", that I use for [my website](https://github.com/pfirsich/theshoemaker).

It's essentially a tool that uses [jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/) according to a configuration, an example of which you can see here: [raydor.yml](https://github.com/pfirsich/theshoemaker/blob/main/raydor.yml).
